===== Tools in the ALM and beyond... =====



==== Reference Enterprise Solution ====



In order to evaluation tools, we are going to make some assumptions:

  * Enterprise applications look like [[:tools:reference implementations| this]].

  * The organization aligns with the major [[:frameworks:overview|Frameworks]] and BOKs like ITIL, ITSQB, etc



==== Evaluations ====



The following tools are evaluated following the [[http://www.instantpii.org/doku.php?id=processes:evaluate_a_tool|Tool evaluation process]] from the [[http://www.instantpii.org|InstantPII]] website.



Where applicable these tools are mapped to the particular process/practice where they are used so that a consolidated view starts to emerge. The following tools have been identified:
