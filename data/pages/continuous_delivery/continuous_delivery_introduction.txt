===== Continuous Delivery Overview =====



Continuous delivery is a software development strategy that optimizes your delivery process to get high-quality, valuable software delivered as quickly as possible. This approach allows you to validate your business hypothesis fast and then rapidly iterate by testing new ideas on users. Although Continuous Delivery focuses on engineering practices, the concept of continuous delivery has implications for the whole product-delivery process, including the “fuzzy front end” and the design and analysis of features.
